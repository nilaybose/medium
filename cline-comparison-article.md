"Help me with the user interface"
```

## **Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them**

### **The "Simple Fix" Token Burn: A Real-World Horror Story**

**The Scenario:**
You have a React app with a seemingly simple bug: "The login button doesn't work on mobile devices." You ask Cline to fix it, thinking it's a quick CSS issue.

**What Actually Happens:**

```
Developer: "Fix the login button - it doesn't work on mobile"

Cline's Investigation Process:
1. Analyzes entire React component tree (50+ components) - 15K tokens
2. Examines CSS files and responsive breakpoints - 8K tokens  
3. Checks mobile-specific event handlers - 5K tokens
4. Reviews authentication flow across 12 files - 20K tokens
5. Tests button accessibility and touch events - 7K tokens
6. Investigates state management (Redux store) - 12K tokens
7. Checks for conflicting CSS frameworks - 6K tokens
8. Analyzes build configuration for mobile - 4K tokens
9. Reviews service worker for offline functionality - 3K tokens
10. Examines error logging and debugging setup - 5K tokens

Total: 85,000+ tokens consumed
Actual fix needed: Adding `touch-action: manipulation` to one CSS class
Cost: $85+ (at $1 per 1K tokens)
Time: 45 minutes of autonomous exploration
```

**The Root Cause:**
The vague prompt "doesn't work on mobile" triggered Cline's comprehensive investigation mode. Without specific boundaries, it explored every possible mobile-related issue in the entire codebase.

**How This Could Have Been Avoided:**

**❌ Vague Request:**
```
"Fix the login button - it doesn't work on mobile"
```

**✅ Specific Request:**
```
"The login button in src/components/LoginForm.tsx has touch/tap issues on iOS Safari. 
Focus only on CSS touch-action properties and button event handlers in this component."
```

**Token Usage Comparison:**
- **Vague approach**: 85K tokens, $85, 45 minutes
- **Specific approach**: 3K tokens, $3, 5 minutes
- **Savings**: 96% cost reduction, 90% time savings

**The GitHub Copilot Alternative:**
With the same vague request, Copilot would have:
1. Provided general mobile debugging suggestions
2. Required you to investigate and narrow down the issue
3. Offered specific code completions once you identified the problem
4. **Total cost**: $0 additional (fixed monthly fee)
5. **Time**: 15 minutes of guided investigation

### **Another Token Trap: The "Performance Issue" Rabbit Hole**

**The Scenario:**
```
Developer: "The app feels slow, make it faster"

Cline's Exploration:
- Database query optimization analysis - 25K tokens
- Frontend bundle size investigation - 15K tokens  
- API response time profiling - 12K tokens
- Memory leak detection across all components - 30K tokens
- Image optimization review - 8K tokens
- Caching strategy analysis - 10K tokens
- Server-side rendering evaluation - 18K tokens

Total: 118K tokens = $118+
Actual issue: One unoptimized image causing layout shift
```

**The Pattern Recognition:**
These scenarios share common characteristics:
1. **Vague problem description** - Triggers broad investigation
2. **No scope boundaries** - AI explores entire codebase
3. **Symptom vs. root cause** - Describes effect, not specific issue
4. **Missing context** - No indication of where to focus

### **The "AI Dependency Trap"**
**Problem**: Over-relying on AI for simple tasks
**Solution**: Maintain core coding skills, use AI for complex problems

### **The "Token Burn"**
**Problem**: Letting AI tools explore without boundaries
**Solution**: Set clear scope and monitor progress actively

### **The "Wrong Tool" Problem**
**Problem**: Using expensive tools for simple tasks
**Solution**: Match tool capability to task complexity
